        <li>Unlike traditional goods, data is non-rivalrous, i.e., it can be copied any number of times. So, concepts developed for traditional goods, like competitive equilibrium, don't carry over directly to data markets.</li>
        <li>Given buyers' valuations for different datasets, we devise algorithms for pricing them such that the total revenue is maximized.</li>

    <ul>
        <li> Designed approximation algorithms for rectangle bin packing when items
            are skewed, i.e., each item either has small width or small height. </li>
        <li> Designed approximation algorithms for a variant of bin packing that
            generalizes geometric bin packing and vector bin packing. </li>
        <li> Designed an approximation algorithm for d-dimensional geometric bin packing
            when items are allowed to be rotated. This algorithm gives the best-known
            approximation factor for d ≥ 3. </li>
        <li> Worked on the online knapsack problem in the random-order model.
            Obtained hardness results and improved algorithms for some special cases
            (profit=size and profit=1). </li>

    <ul>
        <li> Studied DNS-related DoS attacks and Software-Defined Networking (SDN). </li>
        <li> Devised a new mechanism for mitigating DNS amplification attacks,
            which uses a set of geographically-distributed SDN routers. </li>
        <li> I presented a paper on it at
            <a href="http://icacci-conference.org/2018/">ICACCI</a> in September 2018. </li>

    <ul>
        <li> Trained a neural network from almost-raw data to estimate
            the probability of a credit-card applicant defaulting. </li>
        <li> The data was in a unique format, so a custom neural network architecture was devised. </li>
        <li> The neural network's performance was at par with the model then in production,
            which was tuned over many years and utilized several complex hand-engineered features. </li>

    <ul>
        <li> Invented a clustering algorithm, which I named CT-means.
            It is an approximation to C-means fuzzy clustering.
            It uses KD-trees to reduce running time. </li>
        <li> Mathematically proved its convergence and approximation guarantees. </li>
        <li> <a href="https://github.com/sharmaeklavya2/ctmeans">Implemented</a>
            the algorithm and benchmarked its performance on different datasets.
            It was not significantly faster in practice and its applicability was limited. </li>
