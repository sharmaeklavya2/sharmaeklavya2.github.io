<h1><a href=".">Eklavya Sharma</a>: Notes</h1>

<p>
I write down important stuff for later reference.
I used to do it in notebooks made of paper, but they are hard to edit,
hard to share, and quite non-portable.
So now I use digital formats, like PDF and HTML.
</p>

<p>
There is no single format that is appropriate for all of my notes.
As a result, my notes are stored in different places,
and each place has a different format.
Here I'll provide links to most of them.

    <li> TheoremDep is a website that lists many theorems and shows the dependencies between them.
        Theorem X is said to be dependent on theorem Y iff Y is used as a lemma in the proof of X.</li>
    <li> I created TheoremDep to better organize and document my own knowledge.
        TheoremDep mainly contains theorems on abstract algebra, linear algebra,
        number theory, graph theory, bin-packing and probability.</li>
    <li> Theorems are authored in JSON+Markdown+MathJax.
        <a href="https://github.com/sharmaeklavya2/concepdag">ConcepDAG</a>
        converts them to an HTML+MathJax website.</li>

    <li> Some of my notes don't fit into the &lsquo;graph of theorems&rsquo; representation,
        so instead of adding them to TheoremDep, I use a more self-contained format for them.</li>
    <li> The notes are authored in LaTeX and markdown.
        LaTeX is compiled to PDF and markdown is compiled to HTML.</li>
