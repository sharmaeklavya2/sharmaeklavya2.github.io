    <h3> <a href="https://sharmaeklavya2.github.io/theoremdep/">TheoremDep</a>

        <br/> <span class="topics">Topics: math, web development.</span> </h3>
    <ul>
    <li> TheoremDep is a website that lists many theorems and shows the dependencies between them.
        Theorem X is said to be dependent on theorem Y iff Y is used as a lemma in the proof of X.</li>
    <li> I created TheoremDep to better organize and document my own knowledge. TheoremDep mainly contains theorems
        on abstract algebra, linear algebra, number theory and graph theory.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> <a href="dl/papers/ps2_report.pdf"> Internship at American Express, Gurgaon </a>
        <span class="date">(Jan 2018 - June 2018)</span>
        <br/> <span class="topics">Topics: neural networks, machine learning, big data.</span> </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Trained a neural network from almost-raw data to estimate
            the probability of a credit-card applicant defaulting. </li>
        <li> The data was in a unique format, so a custom neural network architecture was devised. </li>
        <li> The neural network's performance was at par with the model then in production,
            which was tuned over many years and utilized several complex hand-engineered features. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> <a href="dl/papers/aac_report.pdf"> Analysis of Primality-testing Algorithms </a>

        <br/> <span class="topics">Advanced Algorithms and Complexity course project</span>
        <br/> <span class="topics">Topics: abstract algebra, number theory, computational complexity.</span> </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Studied the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKS_primality_test">
            AKS primality-testing algorithm </a> and attempted to improve it. </li>
        <li> Compared compositeness-proving algorithms like Miller-Rabin,
            Solovay-Strassen, Baillie PSW, etc. </li>

    <h3> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2018.8554459">
        Mitigating DNS-related DoS attacks using SDN </a>
        <span class="date">(Sept 2017 - Dec 2017)</span>
        <br/> <span class="topics">Topics: computer networks, network security, SDN.</span> </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Studied DNS-related DoS attacks and Software-Defined Networking (SDN). </li>
        <li> Devised a new mechanism for mitigating DNS amplification attacks,
            which uses a set of geographically-distributed SDN routers. </li>
        <li> I presented a paper on it at
            <a href="http://icacci-conference.org/2018/">ICACCI</a> in September 2018. </li>

    <h3> <a href="dl/papers/ctmeans.pdf"> CT-means clustering algorithm </a>
        <span class="date">(Nov 2017 - Jan 2018)</span>
        <br/> <span class="topics">Topics: machine learning, algorithms, math.</span> </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Invented a clustering algorithm, which I named CT-means.
            It is an approximation to C-means fuzzy clustering.
            It uses KD-trees to reduce running time. </li>
        <li> Mathematically proved its convergence and approximation guarantees. </li>
        <li> <a href="https://github.com/sharmaeklavya2/ctmeans">Implemented</a>
            the algorithm and benchmarked its performance on different datasets.
            It was not significantly faster in practice and its applicability was limited. </li>
    </ul>
