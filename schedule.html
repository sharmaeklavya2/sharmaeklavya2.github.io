<h1><a href=".">Eklavya</a>: Schedule</h1>

<p>
Here's a (non-exhaustive) list of times when I'm busy.
This should be helpful if you're trying to schedule a meeting with me.
I expect to stick to this schedule till Dec 13, 2022. All times are in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Time_Zone">Central Time Zone</a>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Classes: Tuesday and Thursday, 2 pm to 3:15 pm, and 4:55 pm to 5:55 pm.</li>
<li>Seminars: Monday and Friday, 10 am to 11 am.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I usually wake up at 5:50 am and go to bed at 10 pm.
I go to the gym in the morning once every 2-3 days.
If I don't go to the gym, I start working at roughly 8:30 am.
Otherwise, I start working at roughly 10:30 am.
