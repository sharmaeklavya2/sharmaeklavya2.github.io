# My website

This repository contains my personal website (HTML, CSS, images, icons).

## Features

I wrote the HTML and CSS myself. I didn't use any external CSS/JS libraries/frameworks.
I prioritized speed, usability, best practices, and (to some extend) accessibility
over looks, but the website still looks good to me.
It gets a perfect score on [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)
as of 2022-05-11.
It is responsive and supports both light and dark modes.
